This is a POC server for collecting information from microgrid nodes

Currently it accepts messages from nodes, stores node ip and serial number in memory and can display a html page with the nodes

Use MAVEN to build and jetty:run as maven goal to run the project. Set -Djetty.port=XXX to change port number

use GET /hello to test if server is working. Should respond with "Hello Jersey..."

use POST /hello content type:"application/json" Payload: {"ip":"xxx","sernum":"zzz"} to add new node

user GET /status to get HTML page with nodes
